# terminal-google-shell
creator: HED

this script is made in order to use a temporary debian terminal with the google cloud shell service

link to the google shell cloud: https://console.cloud.google.com/ (is free)

Once the repository is installed, it will not be necessary to reinstall it, but it will be executed every time you want to use it.

I am working on a new version of the script that will create a vnc server to use

in the future after adding vnc server hacking tools will be added
